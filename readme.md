# Portfolio

This is simply my personal portfolio site, which contains a description of my web development skills and projects. You can visit the site [here](https://thrasymachuss.github.io/portfolio/).

The site was created with vanilla Javascript, SCSS, and Vite as the build tool. The website [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/) handles the contact form.

## Current projects

Currently, I am showcasing the following projects:

- An Othello AI, which uses the minimax algorithm.
- A link shortener, which uses Next.js and a MySQL database. Uses NextAuth to handle user authentication.
- A Sudoku generator and solver, which uses recursive backtracking to generate random Sudoku puzzles and solve them. The user can also play through the puzzles, if they so choose.
- A puzzle game of my own invention, called LogicSquare. Much like my Sudoku app, it can generate random puzzles and solve them. The user can also personally play through the puzzles.
