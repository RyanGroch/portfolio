# Portfolio

This is simply my personal portfolio site, which contains a description of my web development skills and projects. You can visit the site [here](https://ryangroch.github.io/portfolio/).

The site was created with vanilla Javascript, SCSS, and Vite as the build tool. The website [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/) handles the contact form.

## Current projects

Currently, I am showcasing the following projects:

- An ecommerce store that I made for a client, called [Lightspeed Triggers](https://lightspeed-triggers.vercel.app/).
- An Othello AI, which uses the minimax algorithm.
- A Sudoku generator and solver, which uses recursive backtracking to generate random Sudoku puzzles and solve them. The user can also play through the puzzles, if they so choose.
- A desktop application which retrieves and displays local electricity prices.
